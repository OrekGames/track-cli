You have access to a GitHub repository octocat/hello-world.

Task:
1. Find issue #1 and review its current state
2. Add a comment "Starting work on this issue"
3. Search for open issues in the repository
4. List all labels available in the repository

Use the track CLI with the -b github flag (or --backend github).

The GitHub repository is octocat/hello-world.
Issue #1 is currently in the open state.
GitHub uses search syntax like "is:open", "is:closed", "label:bug".
Issue IDs are numeric (e.g., 1, 42) or formatted as owner/repo#number.
GitHub does not support deleting issues; close them instead.
